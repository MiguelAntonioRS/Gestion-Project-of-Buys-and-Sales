## üíæ Database Setup

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important!**  
Inside the `DB` folder, you will find **two `.txt` files**:

- The other file contains the **stored procedures** required by the system.

Make sure to run both scripts in your **SQL Server** to set up the necessary database structure and logic before running the application.
